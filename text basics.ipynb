       " 'He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manlyfirmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to beelected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returnedto the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean timeexposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purposeobstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others toencourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of newAppropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Lawsfor establishing Judiciary powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices,and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers toharrass our people, and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent ofour legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to ourconstitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts ofpretended Legislation:For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders whichthey should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases,of the benefits of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offencesFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province,establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as',\n",
       " 'to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the sameabsolute rule into these Colonies:For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and alteringfundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested withpower to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection andwaging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed thelives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleatthe works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances ofCruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totallyunworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bearArms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and\\nBrethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bringon the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known\\nrule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms:Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character isthus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them fromtime to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. Wehave reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We haveappealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of ourcommon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt ourconnections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and ofconsanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation,and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress,Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do,in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish anddeclare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection',\n",
